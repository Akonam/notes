## Asking Questions

How does one ask better, more informed questions?

First, gain a better understanding by using the scientific method:

* **Question** - This is where you think about such questions as:
  "Could it be syntax? Is the iterator condition incorrect? Is the
  variable the value I expect here?"
* **Hypothesis** - This is where you decide what something is, such
  as: "The iteration is executing an extra time than needed."
* **Prediction** - This is where you decide to change something, such
  as: "If I reduce the iteration by one, the final value will be X."
* **Testing** - This is where you execute the code with that change.
* **Analysis** - What happened? What did you observe?

Repeat the scientific method until your problem is solved.

Using the scientific method may even make you feel like you are
understanding it when your questions are based on concepts you already
know and what you expected the results to be. Perhaps the syntax or
current implementation is causing the confusion.

After thinking in this way, you'll be able to ask better questions.

For example your question framing could sound like:

"This is what I'm trying to do, this is where I am, this is the end
result that I'm expecting, and this is what I suspect is wrong. How
can I address XYZ specific thing that will get me towards what I'm
trying to do?"

## Eye Strain and Headaches

Read about
the
[20-20-20 rule on Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/5591835/reduce-computer-caused-eye-strain-with-the-20-20-20-rule).

>To help you deal with this problem, the 20-20-20 rule suggest that
>after every 20 minutes, you (the computer user) should take a break
>for at least 20 seconds and look at objects that are 20 feet away
>from you.

MacOS Apps, such as [Look Up](http://www.96problems.com/look-up/), can
help remind you.

## Body Strain and Blood Circulation Restriction

Sitting down for more than an hour is not good for the body. Stand up
and walk around frequently to get blood flowing in your lower body and
legs.

Stretch and move around to improve brain function.

You can combine this activity with the 20-20-20 rule above.

## Time Management - Pomodoro Technique

Read about
the
[pomodoro technique on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).

>There are six steps in the technique:
>
>1. Decide on the task to be done.
>2. Set the pomodoro timer (traditionally to 25 minutes).
>3. Work on the task until the timer rings.
>4. After the timer rings put a checkmark on a piece of paper.
>5. If you have fewer than four checkmarks, take a short break (3 - 5
>   minutes), then go to step 2.
>6. After four pomodoros, take a longer break (15 - 30 minutes), reset
>   your checkmark count to zero, then go to step 1.

## Time Management - Procrastination hack '(10+2)*5'

Read about
the
[procrastination hack on 43folders](http://www.43folders.com/2005/10/11/procrastination-hack-1025).

>**How it works**
>
>It's called "(10+2)*5" and here's why:
>
>* **10** - Work for ten minutes with single-minded focus on moving
>  toward completion on a single task. Ten minutes, and that's all
>  you're allowed to do is work, work, work. No cheating, because
>  (**DING!**) you actually get a break when you're done...
>* **2** - After ten minutes of sweaty, dedicated work you get a
>  2-minute break to do whatever you want - drink coffee, read 5ives,
>  call your bookie, whatever. When the two minutes are up, it's back
>  to work on the **next** task on your list. This is important.
>* ***5** - You're going to iterate this four more times for a total of
>  one hour's working/breaking.
>
>**Important squirrely rules**
>
>* You do not need to finish your task or your project in ten minutes;
>  you just need to move it forward
>* If you finish a satisfying amount of work in fewer than ten minutes,
>  STOP, and go right to your 2-minute break, than start another
>  10-minute dash
>* **Do NOT skip breaks!** You are not allowed. Breaks cannot be
>  missed. Period. Go surf the web. Now. Seriously. GO!
>
>**What will happen**
>
>You'll blaze through an hour's worth of work/not work and will find
>yourself looking forward to both the breaking and working parts of the
>cycle. (Dang, how's that for a change?)
